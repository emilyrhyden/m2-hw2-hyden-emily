    <h1>Emily Hyden</h1>
    <p>This is a webpage about me, my hobbies, interests, and career goals.</p>
    
    <h2>Hobbies</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Playing flute</li>
        <li>Rock climbing</li>
        <li>Reading</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I don't have much free time - I work full time at a company I have to commute to every day. However, when I do have free time, writing, climbing, and playing music are three activities that bring me comfort and joy.</p>
    
    <h3>Favorite Hobby</h3>
    <p>My favorite hobby is playing flute. I have played since I was 12 years old. I am currently a member of the San Francisco Civic Symphony. My most recent concert was Sunday, August 25th. I performed my favorite piece: Dvorak's New World Symphony. Playing music makes me feel alive and grounded in the present moment.</p>

    <h2>Interests</h2>
    <p>I am interested in economics, politics, history, and the intersections of the three. I enjoy writing analytical essays about such topics and follow along closely with both domestic and international politics. I studied International Studies & Economics in undergrad and minored in Chinese. My thesis explored Chinese foreign aid mechanisms and their alignment with Confucian principles, examining how these aid practices reflect and promote traditional values.</p>
    
    <h2>Career Goals</h2>
    <p>Over the span of my career, I would love to oversee communications strategy for a major campaign or political advocacy group. I would also like to open my own communications consulting firm one day and become a trusted sage in my field. The end goal of course is to retire young knowing I left a mark on the world!</p>
    <p>The ACLU's copy and branding is the type of work I aspire to create. See some examples at <a href="https://www.aclu.org/campaigns-initiatives" target="_blank">ACLU Campaigns</a>.</p>
